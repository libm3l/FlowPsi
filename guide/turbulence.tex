\section{Turbulence Models}

Several turbulence models are implemented in CHEM, including the
algebraic Baldwin-Lomax\cite{BL.78}, the one-equation
Spalart-Allmaras\cite{SA.92}, and a family of two-equation models
including the SST formulation by Menter\cite{Menter.92}.  These models are
briefly described in the following sections.
