\section{Governing Equations}
A finite-volume procedure is applied to discretize the flow equations.
After integration over a computational cell, the governing equations
for a three-dimensional flow with non-equilibrium chemistry and
equilibrium internal energy, written in vector form for an arbitrary control 
volume $\Omega_c$ (closed by a boundary $\partial\Omega_c$) are: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \int_{\Omega_c(t)} Q ~dV +
\int_{{\partial\Omega_c}(t)} (F_i-F_v) ~dS = 0
\label{gov_integral}
\end{equation}
where the vectors of conservative state variables, $Q$, inviscid flux, $F_i$, 
viscous flux, $F_v$, and chemistry source term, $\Dot{W}$, are given by:

\begin{equation}
Q =
\begin{bmatrix}
\rho \\
\rho \Tilde{u} \\
\rho e_0
\end{bmatrix}
,\quad
F_i =
\begin{bmatrix}
\rho \Tilde{u} \cdot \Tilde{n} \\
(\rho \Tilde{u} \Tilde{u} + p \Tilde{\Tilde{I}})\cdot \Tilde{n}\\
\left(\rho e_0 + p\right)\Tilde{u} \cdot \Tilde{n}
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
F_v =
\begin{bmatrix}
0
\Tilde{\Tilde{\tau}} \cdot \Tilde{n}\\
(\Tilde{u} \cdot\Tilde{\Tilde{\tau}} + \Tilde{q} 
\end{bmatrix}
. 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Thermodynamic Model}

The equations are closed using the ideal gas model where pressure is defined
by 
\begin{equation}
p = \rho \tilde{R} T.
\label{state}
\end{equation}
In Eq.~(\ref{state}),
pressure is related to gas temperature, which is determined from the
internal energy, $e_{internal}$.  Moreover,
\begin{equation}
e_0 = \frac{1}{2}\Tilde{u} \cdot \Tilde{u} + e_{internal} ,
\label{energy}
\end{equation}
where the total energy $e_0$ appears in the vector of conserved
variables.
\begin{equation}
e_{internal} = \frac{\tilde{R} T}{\gamma - 1}
\end{equation} 

Note that $\tilde{R}=\hat{R}/m$ is the specific gas constant which is
the ratio of the universal gas constant $\hat{R}$ to the mean
molecular mass, $m$.
