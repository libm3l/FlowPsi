\subsection{The Gust Modeling}

The model which is used in the \emph{flowPsi} to model the gust is call a 
Disturbance Velocity Approach, DVM. This approach is based on idea of adding 
additional grid velocity, which is given by a gust. As the gust moves, the 
grid velocities in the computational domain are space and time dependent. 
The model which is currently implemented in \emph{flowPsi} is \emph{1-cos} gust

\subsubsection{1-cosine Gust}
The \emph{1-cos} gust is defined by euqation
\begin{equation}
u_g = U_{V}\Bigg(1-cos\Big(\frac{\pi S}{L}\Big)\Bigg)
\end{equation}
where $U_{V}$ is the maximum vertical gust velocity, $L$ is the gust gradient length 
and $S$ is a penetration distance into the gust.
