\subsection{The Gust Modeling}

The model which is used in the \emph{flowPsi} to model the gust is call a 
Disturbance Velocity Approach, DVM. This approach is based on idea of adding 
additional grid velocity, which is given by a gust. As the gust moves, the 
grid velocities in the computational domain are space and time dependent. 
The model which is currently implemented in \emph{flowPsi} is \emph{1-cos} gust

\subsubsection{1-cosine Gust}
The \emph{1-cos} gust is a discreet gust which assumes the gust velocities have \emph{1-cosine} profile\cite{USDT}.
The equation of  \emph{1-cosine} gust is 
\begin{equation}
u_g = \frac{U_{ds}}{2}\Bigg(1-cos\Big(\frac{\pi S}{L}\Big)\Bigg)
\end{equation}
where $U_{ds}$ is the maximum velocity for the gust , $L$ is the gust gradient length 
and $S$ is a gust penetration distance.
