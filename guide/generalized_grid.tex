\section{Numerical Formulation}

The numerical model employed in this study is a finite-volume technique
that supports generalized grids\cite{Koomullil.99} ({\sl generalized grids\/}
are discretizations composed of arbitrary polyhedra, including tetrahedra,
prisms, pyramids, and hexahedra).
Since this formulation is based on
cell centered integrations, any grid type can be expressed, including
``hanging'' nodes found in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).
