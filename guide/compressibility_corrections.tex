\subsection{Turbulence Compressibility Corrections}

Compressibility corrections for high-speed shear flows
\cite{Samimy.90,Sarkar.91} are implemented in the turbulence
equations.  These corrections are expected to improve the results on
problems involving high speed free shear flows.  For the BSL and SST
turbulence models we implement Wilcox's \cite{WilcoxBook} modification
to the correction.  The compressibility correction is implemented as a
modification to the $\beta$ and $\beta^*$ destruction terms that
appear in equations (\ref{kb-turb}) and (\ref{omega-turb}) such that
the new constants are given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta^*_{corr}&=& \beta^*[1+\xi^*F(M_t)],\\
\beta_{corr} &=& \beta-\beta^*\xi^* F(M_t),
\end{eqnarray}
where $F(M_t) = \max(M_t^2 - M^2_{t_0},0)$.  We recover Sarkar's
original model by setting $\xi^* = 1$ and $M_{t_0} = 0$, and Wilcox's
modification by setting $\xi^* = \frac{3}{2}$, and $M_{t_0} =
\frac{1}{4}$.  The correction is disabled by setting $\xi^* = 0$.
