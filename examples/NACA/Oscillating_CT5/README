This is an oscillating NACA 0012 case which illustrates external communication
FlowPsi sends actual time of simulation to the external sovler which then 
calculates alpha, beta and gamma euler angles, converts them to quaternion
and sends back to flowPsi. FlowPsi then turns the mesh and makes additional time step. 
The communication occurs every time step.

1. run stady case using NACAViscous_STD.vars

2. move restart file to restart_STD directory

3. execute unsteady analysis

  3a. start lsipdx co-sumulation engine using Definition_File in this directory
      example: lsipdx_server.out --port 31000 --input_file Definition_File --show

  3b. start separate solver in ExternalProcesses (from External_Processes directory)
     Client1_FakedSimulink_Quaternion.out localhost 31000

  3c execute FlowPsi with NACAViscousi_USTD.vars input file


Once the process is finished, kill lsipdx co-sumulation engine

4. Posptprocess results - 
   use 
   awk 'NR>300 {print 0.016+2.51*sin(2*3.1415926*6.6565344171*$1*2E-4), $6/1030.032519344/0.1}' output/flux_BC_2.dat > FZ

   to get normal force vs. angle of attack
