This is an oscillating NACA 0012 case which illustrates external communication

1. run stady case using NACAViscous_STD.vars

2. move restart file to restart_STD directory

3. execute unsteady analysis

  3a. start lsipdx co-sumulation engine using Definition_File in this directory
  3b. start separate solver in ExternalProcesses as
     Client1_FakedSimulink_Quaternion.out localhost 31000
  3c execute FlowPsi with NACAViscous.vars input file


Once the process is finished, kill lsipdx co-sumulation engine

4. Posptprocess results - 
   use 
   awk 'NR>300 {print 0.016+2.51*sin(2*3.1415926*6.6565344171*$1*2E-4), $6/1030.032519344/0.1}' output/flux_BC_2.dat > FZ

   to get normal forces vs. angle of attack
